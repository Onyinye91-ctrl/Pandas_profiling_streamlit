# Pandas_profiling_streamlit
Using pandas_profiling with Sreamlit


I will be using this dataset in this link https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dataprofessor/data/master/penguins_cleaned.csv. The dataset is about penguins.
I had issues using profile_report on pandas_filing. it was throwing that pandas_profiling has no attribute profile_report. So i had to do some google search (it my hours to find the solution) were someone says at it states `Some of the version of the pandas-profiling does not work for me and I installed 2.8.0 version and it work for me.` With this i had to install pandas_profilling==2.8.0 as recommended. Yeah problem solved.
